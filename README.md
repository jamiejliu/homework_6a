For homework 6a, my website is able to schedule & save appointments.
You can schedule appointments either from the home page or the appointments tab.

After scheduling a new appointment, you will see a confirmation page with the appointment details.

In the future, you will be able to manage your appointments from the appointments tab. I have not built out that functionality yet. I also have not built out the lab results or forms pages yet.
